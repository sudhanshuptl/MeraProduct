# MeraProduct Icons

This directory contains the extension icons. For a real extension, you would need to create actual PNG icon files.

## Required Icon Sizes:

- **icon16.png**: 16x16 pixels (toolbar and context menus)
- **icon32.png**: 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often display this size)
- **icon48.png**: 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- **icon128.png**: 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Design Guidelines:

- Use the Indian flag colors: Saffron (#FF9933), White (#FFFFFF), Green (#138808)
- Include the ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ flag emoji or a stylized version
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Tools for Icon Creation:

- **Figma**: Free design tool with export capabilities
- **Canva**: Easy-to-use online design platform
- **GIMP**: Free image editing software
- **Adobe Illustrator**: Professional vector graphics tool

## Current Status:

These are placeholder files. Replace with actual PNG icons before publishing the extension.

To create quick placeholder icons for testing:

1. Create 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images
2. Use a simple design with Indian flag colors
3. Save as PNG files with the exact names listed above
4. Place them in this directory
