# Product History Feature - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Feature Overview
The MeraProduct extension now tracks your browsing history of products checked for "Made in India" status. This feature stores the last 30 products with full metadata and displays them in a beautiful popup UI.

## 📋 What's New

### 1. Product Storage Utility (`src/utils/storage.js`)
- **Purpose**: Manage product history in `chrome.storage.local`
- **Features**:
  - Save products with full metadata (name, URL, image, confidence, etc.)
  - Automatic duplicate handling by URL (updates existing entries)
  - Limit to 30 most recent products
  - Statistics calculation (total, Made in India count, success rate %)
  - Delete individual products or clear all history

### 2. Enhanced Content Scripts
Both Amazon and Flipkart content scripts now:
- Capture product name from page title
- Extract product image (thumbnail)
- Save product to history automatically when badge is displayed
- Store metadata: site, confidence score, indicator, manufacturer info

### 3. Beautiful Popup UI (`src/popup/`)
- **Modern Design**: Gradient header with Indian flag theme
- **Statistics Panel**: 
  - Products Checked (total count)
  - Made in India (success count)
  - Success Rate (percentage)
- **Product History List**:
  - Product thumbnails with fallback icon
  - Product name (truncated for readability)
  - Badge indicator (green for India, red for non-India)
  - Confidence percentage (toggleable)
  - Site name (Flipkart/Amazon)
  - Relative timestamp (e.g., "2h ago")
  - Delete button (appears on hover)
- **Actions**:
  - Click product card → Opens product URL in new tab
  - Refresh button → Reload history
  - Clear History button → Delete all products (with confirmation)
- **Settings Panel**:
  - Debug Mode toggle (enable/disable console logging)
  - Show Confidence Score toggle (show/hide in product cards)

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Data Structure
Each product is stored with:
```javascript
{
  id: 1697801234567,        // Unique timestamp ID
  timestamp: 1697801234567, // When detected
  name: "Product Name",     // From page title
  url: "https://...",       // Product page URL
  site: "flipkart",         // "flipkart" or "amazon"
  isMadeInIndia: true,      // Boolean flag
  confidence: 95,           // Percentage (0-100)
  indicator: "🇮🇳 MADE IN INDIA", // Badge text
  manufacturer: "Company",  // Optional manufacturer info
  image: "https://..."      // Product thumbnail URL
}
```

### Storage Mechanism
- Uses `chrome.storage.local` API for persistence
- Storage key: `meraproduct_history`
- Maximum 30 products (FIFO - oldest removed first)
- Duplicates handled by URL (existing entry moved to top with updated timestamp)

### Auto-Refresh
- Popup auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Listens to `chrome.storage.onChanged` for real-time updates
- Manual refresh available via button

## 🎨 Design Features

### Visual Highlights:

- **Truncated Text**: Product names limited to 2 lines with ellipsis
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental history deletion
- **Settings Persistence**: Uses localStorage for user preferences

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check Storage:
```javascript
// In browser console
chrome.storage.local.get('meraproduct_history', (result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

### Clear Storage (if needed):
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.clear(() => {
  console.log('Storage cleared');
});
```

### Monitor Changes:
```javascript
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, namespace) => {
  console.log('Storage changed:', changes);
});
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations
1. Storage limited to 30 products (by design)
2. Images may fail to load if external URLs expire
3. Timestamps are browser-local (no timezone handling)
4. No sync across devices (uses local storage only)
