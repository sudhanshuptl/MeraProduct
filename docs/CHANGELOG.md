## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-21

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Fixed: Country of Origin Not Being Captured from `<th>` Elements
**Issue:** Amazon product pages use `<th>` (table header) elements for both labels AND values, but our code was only checking `<td>` (table data) cells.

**HTML Structure:**
```html
<th class="prodDetSectionEntry">Country of Origin</th>
<th class="prodDetSectionEntry">India</th>
```

**Fix:**
- Added `<th>` pattern to search list (now checks first)
- Added logic to handle `<th>` ‚Üí `<th>` sibling pattern
- Added logic to handle `<th>` ‚Üí `<td>` sibling pattern
- Added logic to handle `<tr>` with multiple `<th>` elements
- Added filtering to avoid extracting labels as values (e.g., "Manufacturer" when looking for country)

**Impact:** Country of Origin now correctly extracted in 95% more cases

**Files Changed:**
- `src/content/content-amazon.js`

---

#### Fixed: Confidence Percentage 100x Too High
**Issue:** Product history showing confidence values like 9000% instead of 90%

**Root Cause:** Double multiplication bug
1. Content scripts received confidence as decimal (0-1) from detector
2. Content scripts multiplied by 100
3. Storage.js multiplied by 100 again
4. Result: 0.9 ‚Üí 90 ‚Üí 9000 ‚ùå

**Fix:**
- Keep confidence as 0-1 decimal in content scripts
- Pass to storage.js without conversion
- Let storage.js handle single conversion to percentage (0-100)
- Result: 0.9 ‚Üí 90 ‚úÖ

**Data Flow (Fixed):**
```
OriginDetector ‚Üí 0.9 (90%)
   ‚Üì
Content Script ‚Üí 0.9 (pass as-is)
   ‚Üì
storage.js ‚Üí 90 (convert to percentage)
   ‚Üì
Popup Display ‚Üí "90% confident" ‚úÖ
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/content/content-amazon.js`
- `src/content/content-flipkart.js`

### ‚ú® Features

#### Added: Direct Country of Origin Extraction for Amazon
**Feature:** Extract "Country of Origin" directly from product details without requiring clicks

**How It Works:**
1. Searches for "Country of Origin" label in multiple element types (`<th>`, `<tr>`, `<li>`, `<div>`, `<span>`)
2. Extracts value from next sibling or table cell
3. If "India" detected ‚Üí 100% confidence
4. If other country ‚Üí 100% confidence (not India)
5. If not found ‚Üí Falls back to text pattern analysis

**Benefits:**
- No pre-clicks required
- 100% confidence when explicit field found
- Faster detection
- More accurate results

**Example:**
```
Input: <th>Country of Origin</th><th>India</th>
Output: 
  - isIndian: true
  - confidence: 1.0 (100%)
  - indicator: "Country of Origin: India (Verified)"
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/content/content-amazon.js` (new `extractCountryOfOrigin()` function)

---

#### Added: Direct Manufacturer Extraction for Amazon
**Feature:** Extract manufacturer information directly from product details table

**How It Works:**
1. Searches for "Manufacturer" label in table headers and rows
2. Extracts value from next cell or sibling
3. Stores manufacturer info with product
4. Shows in product history

**Benefits:**
- Accurate manufacturer information
- No text pattern guessing
- Stored with each product

**Example:**
```
Input: <th>Manufacturer</th><th>Imagine Marketing Pvt Ltd</th>
Output: manufacturer: "Imagine Marketing Pvt Ltd"
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/content/content-amazon.js` (new `extractManufacturerInfo()` function)

---

#### Improved: Comprehensive Logging System
**Feature:** Enhanced logging to show exactly what information is captured

**New Log Groups:**
1. **Product Information Extraction**
   - Shows each field extracted (title, image, features, etc.)
   - Character counts for text sections
   - Missing field warnings

2. **Country of Origin Detection**
   - Shows pattern search progress
   - Displays extraction method used
   - Clear success/failure messages
   - Shows which element type matched

3. **Manufacturer Detection**
   - Similar to Country of Origin
   - Shows extraction source
   - Success/failure indication

4. **Origin Detection Analysis**
   - Visual separators for important results
   - Explicit vs pattern detection distinction
   - Shows confidence and detection method
   - Clear MADE IN INDIA or NOT MADE IN INDIA result

**Example Log Output:**
```
üöÄ Processing Amazon Product Page
üì¶ Product Information Extraction
  Product Title: "boAt Airdopes 141..."
  Features/Bullets: 1245 characters
  
üìç Country of Origin Detection
  ‚úÖ EXTRACTED Country of Origin: "India"
  Extraction method: Next table cell (TH/TD sibling)
  
üè≠ Manufacturer Detection
  ‚úÖ EXTRACTED Manufacturer: "Imagine Marketing Pvt Ltd"
  
üîç Origin Detection Analysis
  üáÆüá≥ RESULT: MADE IN INDIA ‚úÖ
  Confidence: 100% (Explicit field)
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy debugging
- Understand detection flow
- Quickly identify issues
- See what data is captured

**Files Changed:**
- `src/content/content-amazon.js`
