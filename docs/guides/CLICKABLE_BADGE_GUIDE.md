## Questions?

### Why can't the badge open the popup directly?
Chrome extensions have security restrictions that prevent them from opening popups programmatically. This protects users from intrusive popups.

### Why does the icon flash?
To help you discover where the extension icon is! Many users don't notice extension icons in their toolbar.

### Can I disable the flash animation?
Currently no, but we're considering adding this option in future versions based on user feedback.

### Does clicking the badge consume data?
No! Everything happens locally in your browser. No external API calls are made.
