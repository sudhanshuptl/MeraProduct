# Country of Origin Extraction Fix

## Problem Identified

The extension was incorrectly marking Indian products as non-Indian despite properly extracting "Country of Origin: India" data.

### Root Cause

The regex pattern used to extract country of origin was:
```javascript
const countryRegex = /country\s+of\s+origin[\s:]*([^\n]+)/i;
```

This pattern captured everything until the next newline (`[^\n]+`). However, in the Flipkart modal, the text doesn't always have newlines between sections. This resulted in:

**Extracted Data:**
```
Country of Origin: IndiaManufacturer's DetailsImporter's DetailsPacker's Details...
```

Instead of just:
```
Country of Origin: India
```

### Why It Failed

1. The extracted `countryOfOrigin` variable contained: `"IndiaManufacturer's DetailsImporter's DetailsPacker's Details..."`
2. The non-Indian country check failed (correctly) because this string doesn't match "china", "usa", etc.
3. However, the later checks for "India" were only looking at patterns in the full `lowerText`, not the extracted `countryOfOrigin` variable
4. Result: The product fell through all checks and was marked as NOT Indian

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Regex Pattern

```javascript
// New regex that stops at common delimiters
const countryRegex = /country\s+of\s+origin[\s:]*([A-Za-z\s]+?)(?=\s*(?:Manufacturer|Importer|Packer|Details|$|[A-Z]{2,}))/i;
```

This pattern:
- Captures only alphabetic characters and spaces `([A-Za-z\s]+?)`
- Uses a lookahead to stop at common delimiters: "Manufacturer", "Importer", "Packer", "Details", or capital letter sequences
- Fallback to simpler pattern if the extraction is too long (>50 chars)

### 2. Dual Verification

Added explicit check for the extracted country name:

```javascript
// Check both regex pattern in full text AND extracted country name
const hasCountryOfOriginInText = countryOfOriginRegex.test(lowerText) || countryIndiaRegex.test(lowerText);
const hasCountryOfOriginExtracted = countryOfOrigin && countryOfOrigin.toLowerCase().trim() === 'india';
const hasCountryOfOrigin = hasCountryOfOriginInText || hasCountryOfOriginExtracted;
```

This ensures that even if the regex patterns don't match perfectly, we still catch "India" in the extracted country field.

### 3. Enhanced Logging

```javascript
log.debug('Country of Origin: India (regex)?', hasCountryOfOriginInText);
log.debug('Country of Origin: India (extracted)?', hasCountryOfOriginExtracted);
log.debug('Manufacturer is Indian?', hasManufacturerIndia);
```

Now logs both detection methods for easier debugging.

## Test Case

**Input Data:**
```json
{
  "text": "Country of Origin: IndiaManufacturer's DetailsImporter's DetailsPacker's Details Manufactured by: Stovekraft Limited 81 1 Harohalli Industrial Area Kanakapura Taluk Ramanagara Bangalore Karnataka 562112"
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "isIndian": true,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "indicator": "Country of Origin: India + Manufacturer in India",
  "manufacturer": "Stovekraft Limited 81 1 Harohalli Industrial Area Kanakapura Taluk Ramanagara Bangalore Karnataka 562112"
}
```

## Files Modified

- `src/content/content-flipkart.js`
  - Function: `analyzeManufacturingInfo()`
  - Lines: ~530-620

## Testing Instructions

1. Reload the extension in Chrome
2. Visit the Flipkart product page that was failing
3. Open DevTools Console
4. Look for debug logs showing:
   - `Extracted - Country: India` (not "IndiaManufacturer's Details...")
   - `Country of Origin: India (extracted)? true`
   - `Made in India - Country + Manufacturer (100%)`

## CRITICAL: Word Boundary Bug (Fixed)

### Additional Issue Found

After the initial fix, a **critical false positive** was discovered:

**Problem:** The word "Taluk" (a common Indian administrative term) contains "uk", which was being matched as "United Kingdom"!

**Example:**
```
Manufacturer: Kanakapura Taluk Ramanagara Bangalore Karnataka
                        ^^
                        Matched as "UK"!
```

### Solution: Word Boundary Checks

Added a helper function that uses regex word boundaries (`\b`) for single-word country names:

```javascript
const containsCountry = (text, country) => {
  if (!text) return false;
  const lowerText = text.toLowerCase();
  // For multi-word countries, just use includes
  if (country.includes(' ')) {
    return lowerText.includes(country);
  }
  // For single-word countries, use word boundary regex
  const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${country}\\b`, 'i');
  return regex.test(text);
};
```

This ensures:
- "Taluk" does NOT match "uk" ✅
- "UK" or "U.K." DOES match "uk" ✅
- "chinaware" does NOT match "china" ✅
- "China" DOES match "china" ✅

### Test Cases

| Text | Country Check | Old Result | New Result |
|------|---------------|------------|------------|
| "Kanakapura Taluk" | uk | ❌ Match (WRONG) | ✅ No match |
| "Made in UK" | uk | ✅ Match | ✅ Match |
| "Bangkok Thailand" | thailand | ✅ Match | ✅ Match |
| "United States" | usa | ✅ Match | ✅ Match |

## Prevention

Future regex patterns should:
1. Use lookaheads to stop at predictable delimiters
2. Validate extraction length (reasonable country names are < 50 chars)
3. Always have fallback extraction methods
4. Verify extracted data matches expected patterns
5. **Use word boundaries (`\b`) for single-word country matching to avoid false positives**
