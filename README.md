# MeraProduct 🇮🇳

MeraProduct is a lightweight Chrome extension built to empower users to make informed and patriotic purchase decisions.  
It automatically detects whether the product you’re viewing online is *Made in India* and displays key insights like origin, manufacturer, and review summaries.

## ✨ Features

- Works seamlessly on **Amazon**, **Flipkart**, and other major eCommerce platforms.
- Shows product **origin**, **manufacturer details**, and **average review score**.
- Displays an **Indian flag badge** beside verified Indian-made listings.
- Privacy-first – all origin detection happens locally in your browser.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The extension scans the product details section when you open an eCommerce product page.
2. It detects “Country of Origin” tags or similar metadata using a content script.
3. If the product is made in India, it instantly displays a 🇮🇳 badge and origin message.
4. Upcoming releases will include review aggregation and “Indian alternative” suggestions.
