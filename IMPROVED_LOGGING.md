# Improved Logging for Amazon Content Script

## Overview
Enhanced logging to provide clear visibility into what information is captured for manufacturer details and country of origin during product detection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Country of Origin Extraction Logging
**Enhanced `extractCountryOfOrigin()` function with:**

- ✅ **Log Group** - Groups all Country of Origin detection logs together
- ✅ **Pattern Search Details** - Shows how many elements are being checked for each pattern type
- ✅ **Extraction Method** - Clearly indicates which method successfully extracted the data
- ✅ **Detailed Success Messages** - Shows exactly what was extracted
- ✅ **Failure Messages** - Clear indication when Country of Origin is not found

**Example Output:**
```
📍 Country of Origin Detection
  Starting extraction process...
  Searching 4 pattern types...
    Checking 156 Table Row(s)...
    ✓ Found match in Table Row
       Raw text: "Country of Origin    India"
  ✅ EXTRACTED Country of Origin: "India"
  Extraction method: Table cell (TD element)
  Table structure: 2 cells found
```

### 2. Product Information Extraction Logging
**Enhanced `extractProductInfo()` function with:**

- ✅ **Log Group** - Groups all product extraction logs
- ✅ **Individual Field Status** - Shows what was found for each field
- ✅ **Character Counts** - Displays size of extracted text sections
- ✅ **Missing Field Warnings** - Alerts when expected fields aren't found

**Example Output:**
```

  Product Image: ✓ Found
  Features/Bullets: 1245 characters
  Product Details: 3421 characters
  Additional Info: 892 characters
  
✅ Country of Origin stored: "India"
  Combined text now includes explicit Country of Origin

```

### 3. Origin Detection Analysis Logging
**Enhanced `processPage()` function with:**

- ✅ **Processing Header** - Clear start of page processing with URL
- ✅ **Origin Detection Section** - Dedicated section showing detection logic
- ✅ **Explicit vs Pattern Analysis** - Clearly distinguishes between the two methods
- ✅ **Visual Separators** - Makes results easy to spot in console
- ✅ **Confidence Metrics** - Shows confidence percentage and detection method

**Example Output (Explicit Country):**
```
🚀 Processing Amazon Product Page
  URL: https://amazon.in/dp/B08R6JKY5G

🔍 Origin Detection Analysis
  ═══════════════════════════════════════

  Analysis Result: 🇮🇳 Made in India
  Confidence: 90%
  Indicator: Made in India
  Detection Method: Text pattern matching
```

### 4. Manufacturer Information Logging
**New dedicated logging section for manufacturer:**

- ✅ **Manufacturer Extraction Group** - Separate section for manufacturer info
- ✅ **Success/Failure Messages** - Clear indication of what was found
- ✅ **Extraction Source** - Shows where the info came from

**Example Output:**
```

```

### 5. Final Badge Display Logging
**Enhanced final decision logging:**

- ✅ **Visual Separators** - Clear banners for Made in India vs Not Made in India
- ✅ **Action Confirmation** - Shows which badge is being displayed
- ✅ **Reason Display** - Shows why a product is not Indian (if applicable)
- ✅ **Save Confirmation** - Confirms product was saved to history

**Example Output (Made in India):**

    🇮🇳 DISPLAYING INDIAN BADGE
  ═══════════════════════════════════════
  Product saved to history
```

**Example Output (Not Made in India):**
```
  ═══════════════════════════════════════
    🚫 DISPLAYING NON-INDIAN BADGE
  ═══════════════════════════════════════
  Reason: Country of Origin: China
```
