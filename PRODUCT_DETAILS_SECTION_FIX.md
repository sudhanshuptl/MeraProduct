# Product Details Section Support

## Issue
Extension was timing out after checking 40 attempts (20 seconds) because manufacturer data wasn't found in expected tables. Some Amazon product pages have manufacturer information under a different section structure with `<h2>Product details</h2>` heading.

## Solution

### Updated `waitForProductDetails()` Function

Now searches in **TWO locations**:

#### Method 1: All Tables on Page (Original)
```javascript
const allTables = document.querySelectorAll('table');
// Search for manufacturer TH in each table
```

#### Method 2: "Product details" Section (NEW)
```javascript
// Find <h2>Product details</h2> headings
const productDetailsHeadings = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('h2')).filter(
  h => /product\s+details/i.test(h.textContent)
);

// Search tables after these headings
for (const heading of productDetailsHeadings) {
  let nextElement = heading.nextElementSibling;
  while (nextElement) {
    // Find tables and search for manufacturer
    const tables = nextElement.tagName === 'TABLE' ? 
      [nextElement] : 
      nextElement.querySelectorAll('table');
    // ... search for manufacturer in these tables
  }
}
```

### Optimizations

1. **Reduced Timeout**: From 20 seconds to 5 seconds (since we already wait 10 seconds initially)
2. **Early Exit**: Proceeds after 2.5 seconds if ANY manufacturer data found
3. **Progress Tracking**: Logs longest manufacturer found so far
4. **Better Diagnostics**: Shows which sections were searched

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Manufacturer in Standard Tables
```
✅ Found in table "productDetails_detailBullets_sections1"
✅ Extracts: 172 characters
✅ Time: ~0.5 seconds
```

### Case 2: Manufacturer in "Product details" Section
```
✅ Found under <h2>Product details</h2>
✅ Extracts: Full address with location
✅ Time: ~1-2 seconds
```

### Case 3: No Manufacturer Found
```
⚠️ Timeout after 5 seconds
⚠️ Proceeds with Country of Origin only
⚠️ Shows 60% confidence badge
```
