# 🔐 MeraProduct - Permissions Analysis

## 📋 Current Permissions in manifest.json

```json
"permissions": [
  "storage",
  "activeTab",
  "notifications"
],

  "*://*.amazon.in/*",
  "*://www.flipkart.com/*",
  "*://www.flipkart.in/*",

]
```

## ✅ Required Permissions Analysis

### 1. **`storage`** ✅ REQUIRED

**Purpose:** Store product history and user preferences locally

**Usage in Code:**
- `src/utils/storage.js` - Product history management (30+ uses)
- `src/popup/popup.js` - Load/save product history
- `src/background/service-worker.js` - Detection history, error logs
- `src/utils/common.js` - Settings storage

**Examples:**
```javascript
// Save product to history
chrome.storage.local.set({ [this.STORAGE_KEY]: limitedHistory });

// Load product history
chrome.storage.local.get(this.STORAGE_KEY);

// Clear history
chrome.storage.local.remove(this.STORAGE_KEY);
```

**Justification:** Essential for saving product detection history (last 30 products) and user preferences (debug mode, confidence display settings).

**Verdict:** ✅ **KEEP** - Actively used throughout the extension

---

### 2. **`activeTab`** ✅ REQUIRED

**Purpose:** Access current tab to send messages and interact with content scripts

**Usage in Code:**
- `src/popup/popup.js` - Send debug mode toggle to active tabs
- `src/popup/popup.js` - Create new tabs for product URLs
- `src/background/service-worker.js` - Monitor tab updates, set badge icons

**Examples:**
```javascript
// Send message to active tabs
chrome.tabs.query({}, tabs => {
  tabs.forEach(tab => {
    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { 
      action: 'TOGGLE_DEBUG_MODE', 
      enabled: isEnabled 
    });
  });
});

// Open product in new tab
chrome.tabs.create({ url: productUrl });

// Set badge on specific tab
chrome.action.setBadgeText({ text: '🇮🇳', tabId: tabId });
```

**Justification:** Required to communicate between popup and content scripts, and to display badge icons on product pages.

**Verdict:** ✅ **KEEP** - Essential for tab interaction and messaging

---

### 3. **`notifications`** ⚠️ OPTIONAL (Used but can be removed)

**Purpose:** Show browser notifications when products are detected

**Usage in Code:**
- `src/background/service-worker.js` - Show browser notification on detection

**Examples:**
```javascript
chrome.notifications.create({
  type: 'basic',
  iconUrl: 'assets/icons/icon128.png',
  title: 'MeraProduct',
  message: 'Made in India product detected!'
});
```

**Current Implementation:**
- You're using **in-page notifications** (floating toast messages) in `origin-detector.js`
- Browser notifications in `service-worker.js` are **barely used** and could be removed
- The floating badge already provides visual feedback

**Justification:** 
- ⚠️ Currently used for browser notifications
- ✅ Could be removed if you rely only on in-page notifications
- The floating badge + toast notifications are sufficient

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **OPTIONAL** - Consider removing if you want minimal permissions

---

### 4. **`host_permissions`** ✅ REQUIRED

**Purpose:** Access e-commerce websites to read product information

**Domains:**
- `*://*.amazon.in/*` - Amazon India
- `*://www.flipkart.com/*` - Flipkart (com)
- `*://www.flipkart.in/*` - Flipkart (in)
- `*://*.myntra.com/*` - Myntra (future support)

**Usage:**
- Content scripts inject into these domains to scan product pages
- Read product titles, descriptions, specifications
- Detect "Country of Origin" information
- Display floating badge with detection results

**Justification:** Core functionality - Cannot detect products without access to these sites.

**Verdict:** ✅ **KEEP** - Absolutely essential for the extension

---

## ❌ Removed Permission

### **`scripting`** ❌ REMOVED

**Why it was there:** Likely added by mistake or for future-proofing

**Why it's not needed:**
- You use **static content scripts** (declared in manifest.json)
- Static content scripts don't require the `scripting` permission
- `scripting` is only needed for **dynamic injection** using:
  - `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`
  - `chrome.scripting.insertCSS()`
  - `chrome.scripting.registerContentScripts()`

**Your implementation:**
```json
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["*://*.amazon.in/*/dp/*"],
    "js": ["src/utils/logger.js", "src/content/content-amazon.js"],
    "css": ["src/content/content.css"]
  }
]
```

This is **static** (not dynamic), so no `scripting` permission needed.

**Chrome Web Store rejection reason:**
> "Requesting but not using the following permission(s): scripting"

**Action taken:** ✅ **REMOVED** from manifest.json

---

## 📊 Final Recommendation

### Keep These (3 permissions)
```json
"permissions": [
  "storage",      // ✅ Essential - Product history & settings
  "activeTab",    // ✅ Essential - Tab messaging & badge icons
  "notifications" // ⚠️ Optional - Browser notifications (consider removing)
]
```

### Keep These (Host Permissions)
```json
"host_permissions": [
  "*://*.amazon.in/*",        // ✅ Essential - Amazon India
  "*://www.flipkart.com/*",   // ✅ Essential - Flipkart
  "*://www.flipkart.in/*",    // ✅ Essential - Flipkart alternate
  "*://*.myntra.com/*"        // ⚠️ Optional - Not implemented yet
]
```

## 🎯 Chrome Web Store Justifications

### For Chrome Web Store Submission

**1. Storage Permission**
> Required to save product detection history locally on user's device. 
> Stores last 30 products viewed and user preferences (debug mode, 
> confidence display). All data stays on user's device - never sent 
> to external servers.

**2. ActiveTab Permission**
> Required to communicate between the extension popup and content 
> scripts running on product pages. Enables sending user preference 
> changes to active tabs and opening product links in new tabs.

**3. Notifications Permission** (if keeping)
> Optional feature to show browser notifications when Made in India 
> products are detected. Can be disabled by user. Provides additional 
> awareness when shopping.

**4. Host Permissions**
> Required to read product information on supported e-commerce sites 
> (Amazon India, Flipkart). Extension scans publicly visible product 
> details to detect "Country of Origin" information. All analysis 
> happens locally - no data is sent to external servers.

## 🔧 Optional: Further Minimize Permissions

If you want **absolute minimal permissions**, you could:

### Option 1: Remove `notifications` ⚠️

**Current usage:**
- Browser notifications in `service-worker.js`
- In-page toast notifications in `origin-detector.js`

**If removed:**
- ✅ Keep in-page toast notifications (no permission needed)
- ✅ Keep floating badge (no permission needed)
- ❌ Remove browser notifications from `service-worker.js`

**Code changes needed:**
1. Remove from manifest.json permissions
2. Remove `chrome.notifications.create()` calls from `service-worker.js`
3. Keep in-page notifications (they work without permission)

### Option 2: Remove Myntra host permission

**Current status:**
- Myntra support not implemented yet
- No content script for Myntra exists
- Permission listed but unused

**If removed:**
- Only affects future Myntra support
- Can add back when Myntra support is ready
- Reduces permission request surface

---

## 🚀 Recommended for Chrome Web Store

### Minimal but Functional Configuration

```json
"permissions": [
  "storage",
  "activeTab"
],
"host_permissions": [
  "*://*.amazon.in/*",
  "*://www.flipkart.com/*",
  "*://www.flipkart.in/*"
]
```

**What this removes:**
- ❌ `notifications` - Use only in-page notifications
- ❌ `*://*.myntra.com/*` - Not implemented yet

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fewer permissions = Faster Chrome review
- ✅ More user trust
- ✅ Still fully functional
- ✅ Can add back later if needed

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ No browser notifications (but in-page notifications still work)
- ❌ Can't support Myntra until permission added
